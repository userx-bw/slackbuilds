lxhotkey is a plugin-based shortcuts editor for window managers.

openbox is an optional dependency (and ATM the only window
manager supported).

at the moment this is a command-line only application: the
developer, Andrej N. Gritsenko, invites interested users to
write theirselves the GUI plugins (gtk+, Qt) they need.
